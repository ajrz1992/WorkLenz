# Recurring Tasks: User Guide

## What Are Recurring Tasks?
Recurring tasks are tasks that repeat automatically on a schedule you choose. This helps you save time and ensures important work is never forgotten. For example, you can set up a recurring task for weekly team meetings, monthly reports, or daily check-ins.

## Why Use Recurring Tasks?
- **Save time:** No need to create the same task over and over.
- **Stay organized:** Tasks appear automatically when needed.
- **Never miss a deadline:** Tasks are created on time, every time.

## How to Set Up a Recurring Task
1. Go to the tasks section in your workspace.
2. Choose to create a new task and look for the option to make it recurring.
3. Fill in the task details (name, description, assignees, etc.).
4. Select your preferred schedule (see options below).
5. Save the task. It will now be created automatically based on your chosen schedule.

## Schedule Options
You can choose how often your task repeats. Here are the available options:

- **Daily:** The task is created every day.
- **Weekly:** The task is created once a week. You can pick one or more days (e.g., every Monday and Thursday).
- **Monthly:** The task is created once a month. You have two options:
  - **On a specific date:** Choose a date from 1 to 28 (limited to 28 to ensure consistency across all months)
  - **On a specific day:** Choose a week (first, second, third, fourth, or last) and a day of the week
- **Every X Days:** The task is created every specified number of days (e.g., every 3 days)
- **Every X Weeks:** The task is created every specified number of weeks (e.g., every 2 weeks)
- **Every X Months:** The task is created every specified number of months (e.g., every 3 months)

### Examples
- "Send team update" every Friday (weekly)
- "Submit expense report" on the 15th of each month (monthly, specific date)
- "Monthly team meeting" on the first Monday of each month (monthly, specific day)
- "Check backups" every day (daily)
- "Review project status" every Monday and Thursday (weekly, multiple days)
- "Quarterly report" every 3 months (every X months)

## Future Task Creation
The system automatically creates tasks up to a certain point in the future to ensure timely scheduling:

- **Daily Tasks:** Created up to 7 days in advance
- **Weekly Tasks:** Created up to 2 weeks in advance
- **Monthly Tasks:** Created up to 2 months in advance
- **Every X Days/Weeks/Months:** Created up to 2 intervals in advance

This ensures that:
- You always have upcoming tasks visible in your schedule
- Tasks are created at appropriate intervals
- The system maintains a reasonable number of future tasks

## Tips
- You can edit or stop a recurring task at any time.
- Assign team members and labels to recurring tasks for better organization.
- Check your task list regularly to see newly created recurring tasks.
- For monthly tasks, dates are limited to 1-28 to ensure the task occurs on the same date every month.
- Tasks are created automatically within the future limit window - you don't need to manually create them.
- If you need to see tasks further in the future, they will be created automatically as the current tasks are completed.
